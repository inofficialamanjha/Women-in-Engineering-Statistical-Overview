# WOMEN IN ENGINEERING A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW

Women are often under-represented in the academic and professional fields of engineering; however, many females have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently.

A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent.

Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their male counterparts. Gender stereotypes, low rates of female engineering students, and engineering culture are factors that contribute to the current situation where men are dominated in the engineering field.

In this paper, I aim to provide a statistical overview on various aspects and information related to the involvement of women in engineering and STEM fields (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics). At the end, I also provide an overview onto female employment and education in India pertaining to engineering as well as other fields.
